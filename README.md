## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on macOS.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Captures keystrokes and logs them instantly.
- **Discord Integration**: Sends logs to a Discord webhook for real-time monitoring.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage, making it efficient.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for learning about keylogging and ethical hacking practices.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone
cd keylogger.py
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the keylogger, execute the following command:

```bash
python keylogger.py
```

The keylogger will start capturing keystrokes and logging them to a local file. If configured, it will also send logs to your specified Discord webhook.

## Configuration

Before running the keylogger, you may want to configure a few settings:

1. **Set the Discord Webhook**: Open the `config.py` file and add your Discord webhook URL.

   ```python
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"
   ```

2. **Log File Path**: You can also change the path where logs are saved by modifying the `LOG_FILE` variable in `config.py`.

   ```python
   LOG_FILE = "path/to/your/logfile.txt"
   ```

3. **Running in Background**: To run the keylogger in the background, consider using a process manager or running it in a terminal session that can be detached.
